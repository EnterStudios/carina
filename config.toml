# This is the carina cli configuration file
# Define profiles in this file to quickly switch
# between multiple accounts.
#
# Custom environment variables can be used by appending `-var`
# to the setting name, such as apikey-var or password-var.
#
# Example Usage:
# carina --profile prod ls
# carina --profile dev ls
#
# Example Configurations:
#
# The following profile stores its credentials in plain text
# [prod]
# cloud="public"
# username="alicia"
# api-key="abc123"
#
# The following profile retrieves its credentials from environment variables
# [dev]
# cloud="private"
# endpoint="http://10.0.0.3:8080"
# username-var="DEV_USERNAME"
# password-var="DEV_PASSWORD"
#
# The following profile is used when no --profile is specified
# The default profile takes precedence over auto-discovered environment variables
# [default]
# cloud="public"
# username-var="RS_USERNAME"
# apikey-var="RS_API_KEY"
