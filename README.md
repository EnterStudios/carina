## Installation

There are downloads of the built binaries over in [releases](https://github.com/getcarina/carina/releases).

After downloading the version for your system, you'll probably need to rename it,
set it as executable, and put it on a `PATH` you have:

### OS X

```
$ mv carina-darwin-amd64 ~/bin/carina
$ chmod u+x ~/bin/carina
```

### Linux

```
$ mv carina-linux-amd64 ~/bin/carina
$ chmod u+x ~/bin/carina
```

### Windows

TODO: Instructions for Windows. Care to add some?

## Building

The build script assumes you're running go 1.5 or later. If not, upgrade or use
something like [gimme](https://github.com/travis-ci/gimme).

```bash
make carina
```

This creates `carina` in the current directory (there is no `make install` currently).

If you want it to build on prior releases of go, we'd need a PR to change up how
the `Makefile` sets the `LDFLAGS` conditionally based on Go version.

## Releasing

### Prerequisites

The release script relies on [github-release](https://github.com/aktau/github-release). Get it, configure it.

Make sure you're on `master` then run `release.sh` with the next tag and release name.

```bash
./release.sh 0.2.0 "Acute Aquarius"
```

How do you pick the release name?

### Naming things

The hardest problem in computer science is picking names. For releases, we take
an adjective attached combined with the next constellation from an
[alphabetical list of constellations](http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellation_list.html).
It can be alliterative if you like.
