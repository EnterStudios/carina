## Building

The build script assumes you're running go 1.6 or later. If not, upgrade or use
something like [gimme](https://github.com/travis-ci/gimme).

```bash
make
```

This creates `carina` in the current directory (there is no `make install` currently).

**Make Targets**

* `make`: First run for newcomers.
* `make validate`: Run tools like `fmt`.
* `make test`: Run unit tests.
* `make local`: Build for the current dev env, using whatever dependencies that happen to be on the local machine.
* `make cross-build`: The official build.
