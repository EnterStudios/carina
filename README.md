See the [getting started tutorial](https://getcarina.com/docs/getting-started/getting-started-carina-cli/),
and [full documentation](https://getcarina.com/docs/reference/carina-cli/).

## Building

The build script assumes you're running go 1.5 or later. If not, upgrade or use
something like [gimme](https://github.com/travis-ci/gimme).

```bash
make
```

This creates `carina` in the current directory (there is no `make install` currently).

If you want to build without running validation or tests, use `make quick`.
