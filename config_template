# This is the carina cli configuration file
# Define profiles in this file to quickly switch
# between multiple accounts.
#
# The standard credentials discovery is used for any omitted
# values, such as looking for carina, rackspace or openstack
# environment variables.
#
# Custom environment variables can be used by appending `-var`
# to the setting name, such as api-key-var or password-var.
#
# Example Usage:
# carina --profile prod ls
# carina --profile dev ls
# carina --profile test ls
#
# Example Configurations:
#
# The following profile stores its credentials in plain text
# [prod]
# cloud: public
# username: alicia
# api-key: abc123
#
# The following profile retrieves its credentials from environment variables
# [dev]
# cloud: private
# endpoint: http://10.0.0.3:8080
# username-var: DEV_USERNAME
# password-var: DEV_PASSWORD
#
# The following profile discovers the credentials from the
# default environment variables: OS_USERNAME and OS_PASSWORD
# [test]
# cloud: private
# endpoint: http://10.0.0.3:8080
